My capstone project will be a web API application that will allow the user to track tides and currents across the country based on their seaside location that they enter into an input.  The site will use data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) API service specified for the weather station the user selects in their city.  Users will be able to see latitude/longitude, tide levels as well as information about the weather station's age and location.  This could prove to be extremely practical and useful to beachgoers as well as fishermen or boat captains.
